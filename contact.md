Hi, I'm Catalin Rosu and I make stuff on the web.

- I [tweet](//twitter.com/catalinred) a lot on front-end development stuff. More or less.
- Sometimes I share pixels on [Dribbble](//dribbble.com/catalinred).
- I'm on [GitHub](//github.com/catalinred) too. Not so active as I'd like to be, but I try to do my best.
- Follow me on [Instagram](//instagram.com/catalinred), I share random pictures I take with my phone. Mostly clouds and drinks.
- Not a big fan, yet I have a [LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/catalinred) account as well.

If none of the above works for you, just send me an email to **me@catalin.red**.

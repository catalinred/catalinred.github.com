I'm a pretty *social* person so you can find me almost everywhere in the wild. Contact me, I commit to get back to you as soon as I am available and answer any questions you may have.

- I [tweet](//twitter.com/catalinred) a lot on front-end development stuff. More or less. 
- Sometimes I share pixels on [Dribbble](//dribbble.com/catalinred).
- There's a RTD page on [Facebook](//facebook.com/RedTeamDesign), feel free to like it and get in touch to me. 
- I'm on [GitHub](//github.com/catalinred) too. Not so active as I'd like to be, but I try to do my best.
- Add me on [Google+](//plus.google.com/u/0/114910105297465575018), say hello and let's be friends.
- Follow me on [Instagram](//instagram.com/catalinred), I share random pictures I take with my phone.
- Not a big fan, yet I have a [LinkedIn](//linkedin.com/in/catalinred) account as well.

If none of the above works for you, just send me an email to red at **red-team-design.com**.

##Also, you should know that:

- Currently, I am not available for freelance projects. Not enough time.
- I do not publish guest posts here, unless perhaps you have a cool front-end technique you'd like to share.

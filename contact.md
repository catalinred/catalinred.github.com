Hi, I'm <span lang="ro">Cătălin Roșu</span> (Red, <span lang="es">Roja</span>, <span lang="it">Rosso</span>, <span lang="fr">Rouge</span>... you got it) and I am a front-end developer at a company called [Caphyon](https://caphyon.com/).

When I'm not procrastinating, I enjoy and write about cutting-edge CSS and JS techniques on the website you're reading right now and [I tweet](https://twitter.com/catalinred) a lot on front-end development stuff, more or less.

Sometimes I share pixels on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/catalinred) and I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/catalinred) too. If you'll follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/catalinred), I promise to share random pictures I take with my phone, mostly skies, drinks and food. Sometimes I put my [Iron Man mask](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfEVH7xFhV6/) on to fight villains on the internet.

I have a [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/catalinred) account as well, you know, in case you want to connect.

If none of the above works for you, you can send me an email to [me@catalin.red](mailto:me@catalin.red).

Hi, I'm <span lang="ro">Cătălin Roșu</span> (Red, <span lang="es">Roja</span>, <span lang="it">Rosso</span>, <span lang="fr">Rouge</span>...) and I am a front-end developer.

When I'm not procrastinating, I enjoy and write about cutting-edge CSS and JS techniques on the website you're reading right now and [I tweet](https://twitter.com/catalinred) a lot on front-end development stuff, more or less.

If none of the above works for you, you can send me an email to [me@catalin.red](mailto:me@catalin.red).

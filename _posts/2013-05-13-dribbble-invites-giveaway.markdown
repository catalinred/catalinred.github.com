Last month I wrote about my thoughts on [becoming a better developer](http://www.red-team-design.com/becoming-a-better-developer) and not only. This time, to help you join the best design community, I have two [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/catalinred) invites for you.

<!-- more -->

There is no contest, all you have to do is to use the comments section to show me your best work and post your Dribbble prospect acccount. I'll review all the entries and pick the two winners that will get the Dribbble invites.

No tweets or likes are required but spreading the word is always nice. :)


## Update

I want to thank you all for sharing your work, I enjoyed looking at every entry that was submitted and it was pretty hard to decide. Unfortunately, I have to pick only two and the invites go to [Oleg Borisov](http://dribbble.com/zaytar) and [Sara Soueidan](http://dribbble.com/sarasoueidan). Congrats you two!

P.S.: Next time I hope I'll have more invites to give away, so keep up the good work!

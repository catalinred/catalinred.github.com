title: Form controls with CSS currentColor and pseudo elements
description: How to build some pretty radio and checkbox form controls using the CSS currentColor keyword and pseudo elements.

Because CSS currentColor value and pseudo elements make a damn good team.

Well, I didn't know about CSS `currentColor` keyword until a while ago. I've started playing around with it and yeah, this is extremely powerful. Some really say that this is the first CSS variable that ever existed, sounds pretty interesting huh?

So, I thought that making some nice custom form controls with pseudo elements and currentColor might be the best possible scenario. With that in mind, I chose to style some radios and checkboxes.

[View demo](/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/custom-form-controls.html) 

## Markup

The markup for a custom radio or checkbook consist of a `label` that wraps both the `input` and the proper text. As you already know, wrapping everything together this way, will allow you to improve the usability for it, without needing to rely on the `for` and `id` pair.

{% highlight html %}
<label class="form-group">
  <input type="checkbox">
  <span class="form-control checkbox">
    Orange
  </span>
</label>
{% endhighlight %}
*The radio markup is similar to above.*

## Styles

Further, I will try to explain a bit almost every single rule of CSS used for this demo. It's not rocket science but I hope you will find it useful.

### General

`box-sizing: border-box` is very useful and demos like the current one are way easier to build with this piece of CSS magic.

{% highlight css %}
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `.form-group` is applied to the HTML label that wraps both checkbox or radio and text respectively. It has a `pointer` style because you may want to add a small usability touch by showing the user that this element is actionable.

Also, in case you were wondering about the `user-select: none;` declaration, unfortunately that's not a standard CSS3 feature and its behavior might change in the future. For now, it's just a cool method of preventing text selection using CSS.

{% highlight css %}
.form-group {
  cursor: pointer;
  line-height: 1;
  user-select: none;            
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this case, we'll customize the radios and checkboxes appearances using pseudo elements, so we'll have to somehow hide the native form controls. The following is one of the [most appropriate](http://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) solution because it avoids using stuff like `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`, stuff that might affect the accessibility.

{% highlight css %}
.form-group > [type="checkbox"],
.form-group > [type="radio"] {
  position: absolute; 
  overflow: hidden; 
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0); 
  height: 1px; width: 1px; 
  margin: -1px; padding: 0; border: 0; 
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the following CSS rules are basically preparing the ground for what's going to happen next. The `.form-control` has a `relative` positioning because its pseudo elements will be `absolute` positioned. 

You might note the `em` units too. Well, using these units allow the form controls to be scaled up and down, based on your `font-size` preferences. And that's pretty cool.

![CSS form control with pseudo elements](/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/form-control-pseudo-elements.gif)

{% highlight css %}
.form-control {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  padding-left: 1.3em;
}

.form-control::before,
.form-control::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}        

.form-control::before {
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border: .1em solid;
}

.form-control::after {
  top: .1em; left: .1em;
  width: .8em; height: .8em;
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Update

Thanks to [Thierry](https://twitter.com/thierrykoblentz/status/531853862689177601), who wrote me on Twitter about the redundant `currentColor` value in this case `border: .1em solid currentColor;`. After all, the `border-color` is inherited from the parent. Doh! :)

### Checkbox

The main trick here is to use the already well known "check" HTML entity, represented by Unicode `U+2714`. Also, for both checkboxes and radios, we're using [adjacent sibling selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors) in order to get the toggling behavior.

Everything else is just CSS poetry.

{% highlight css %}
.form-control.checkbox::before {
  border-radius: .1em;
}

.form-control.checkbox::after {  
  text-align: center;          
  content: "\2714";
  line-height: .8em;                   
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(.5);
  transition: transform .1s ease;
}

.form-group > .form-control.checkbox:hover::after {
  opacity: .4;
}

.form-group > input:checked + .form-control.checkbox::after {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);       
}  
{% endhighlight %}

### Radio

When it comes to the radio form element, we rely heavily on the border property to achieve the desired effect. A bit of `border-radius` for roundness, some `background-clip` to prevent the background expanding underneath its border and we're almost there.

Still, the CSS *VIP* in here is the [`currentColor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentColor_keyword) keyword value, that represents the calculated value of the element's color property. We'll be using later a JavaScript snippet to randomize some colors, just for fun and to see how every form control color is randomly changing.

{% highlight css %}
.form-control.radio::before,
.form-control.radio::after {
  border-radius: 50%;
}

.form-control.radio::after {
  background-color: currentColor;
  background-clip: padding-box;
  border: .2em solid transparent;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: border .1s ease;
}

.form-group >.form-control.radio:hover::after {
  opacity: .4;          
}            

.form-group > input:checked + .form-control.radio::after {
  border-width: .1em;
  opacity: 1;         
}
{% endhighlight %}

## A small JS snippet

To have some fun with colors, I used [PleaseJS](http://www.checkman.io/please/), a JavaScript library for creating random pleasing colors. Just make sure you keep refreshing the [demo](/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/custom-form-controls.html) in order to see some random colored form controls.

{% highlight js %}
var formControl       = document.querySelectorAll('.form-group'),
    formControlLength = formControl.length,
    pleaseColor       = Please.make_color({
      colors_returned: formControlLength,
      saturation: 1,
      value: .9
    });

for (var i = 0; i < formControlLength; i++) {
  formControl[i].style.color = pleaseColor[i];
};
{% endhighlight %}

## Browser support limitations

This does not work on older browsers like IE8 and below, but a decent fallback for IE8 can easily be made with a bit of effort. 

Otherwise, it works just fine on other modern devices and browsers, as far as I tested. Just hit me up if you noticed something weird.

## That's pretty much it

Let me know your thoughts, thanks for reading!

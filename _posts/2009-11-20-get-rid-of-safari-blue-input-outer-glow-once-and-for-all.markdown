<ins>Please keep in mind that removing the default outline styles should always be used with caution and adding an alternative styling is mandatory.</ins>

When you're building web interfaces or just websites you always need to do cross-platform browser testing. As we saw, inputs inherits different styles from browsers and you need to [style them](http://www.red-team-design.com/style-an-input-button). In this article i will show you how simple is to remove Safari's glowing blue outline.

The normal state of our input looks like this:

![safari-blue-outer-glow-state](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/safari-blue-outer-glow-state.png)

Please notice the effect that appears on input focus(we're talking about Mac OS X browser-Safari):

![safari-blue-outer-glow-state2](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/safari-blue-outer-glow-state2.png)

To remove this annoying input effect we just need to add one css line and it will disappear:

{% highlight css %}
input:focus {
  outline: none;
}
{% endhighlight %}

![safari-blue-outer-glow-state3](/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/safari-blue-outer-glow-state3.png)

There you go! Simple but very efficient.

At my beginnings as a web developer, when I first discovered how to clear floats I was so happy and it was for sure an "a-ha" moment. Since then, so many things have changed and new clearing methods have appeared. One thing remained the same: the need to clear floats.

In this article, we'll see some effective solutions for clearing floated elements.

## But first, what is float?

Arranging website page elements was always a struggle for you as a web developer. To achieve your desired website layout, a lot of calculation of [box dimensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#box-dimensions) are needed, and various implementation decisions must be taken as well.

At the beginning, perhaps you used `table` elements to structure your layout, and even if tables are very intuitive, the table purpose is to list tabular data. You also tried the CSS [display](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#display-prop)  values like: `table`, `table-cell` or  `table-row` to build structures, but shortly you gave up as there wasn't enough support for that.

In the end, you got rid of table markup and skipped to `div` floats.

So, **float** is a CSS property which help you aligning and positioning your web page elements.

## Clearing floats

Elements placed after a floated element will wrap around the floated element. To avoid this behavior, you must clear floats. To do that, generally you use the `clear` property which has four values: `left`, `right`, `both` and `none`.

{% highlight html %}
<div style="float:left"></div>
<div style="float:right"></div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
{% endhighlight %}

Beside the above example that requires extra HTML markup, below is a list with some clearing methods that I found very useful (and they do not require extra markup):

## [The shortest clearfix ever](http://www.cssmojo.com/latest_new_clearfix_so_far/)
Considering the latest browser support trends, if you're targeting IE8 and above only - meaning excluding IE6 and IE7 -  you can now rely on a single CSS rule:

{% highlight css %}
.btcf:after {
    content:"";
    display:table;
    clear:both;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## That's it!

### 1.Open Adobe Illustrator and create a new .ai file:

### 2.Select the Type Tool(T) and add the "red" text using these settings and the #B3B3B3 color:


![text-settings](/dist/uploads/2009/11/text-settings.png)

If you don't see the Type window you can bring it to front using the top menu: Window > Type > Character.

This is the result you must achieve. Please note the reduced spacing between the letters.

To continue customizing this text, right-click on it and select "Create Outlines" to transform the text into editable shapes.

### 3.Customize the text


First, create a new shape using the Rectangle Tool (M) like in the following example:

![red-shape](/dist/uploads/2009/11/red-shape.png)

Now with the Pathfinder window activated (Shift+Ctrl+F9 or Window > Pathfinder), select the new square shape and the "e" shape from the "red" text and click on "Minus Front" as showed:

The result after we use the Pathfinder will look like this:

### 4.Add the "design" text


Note that the type settings are the same as i used for the "red" text, just that in this case the letters are capitalized.

### 5.Use the Pathfinder again


Use it as shown earlier to "cut" the "red" text and make it look like this:

### 7.Stylize with Adobe Photoshop


Export the content as .png and open it with Adobe Photoshop. You need now to create custom shapes to add lights and shadows to the design. To do that just select the Pen tool (P) from the left menu and start creating shapes as shown.Select the #ffffff(white) color as background and reduce its opacity to, let's say, 20%.

This should be the result after adding lights:

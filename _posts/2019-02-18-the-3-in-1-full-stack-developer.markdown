I attended a presentation at a local university in my hometown and I gave a small talk on web design and development topics. The main discussion focus was about the junior students and their path to becoming developers and perhaps future colleagues.

The meeting was cool, a success, not the first I was attending, but one question a student asked stuck in my mind and especially the answer that another speaker gave to that specific question.

## OK ðŸ˜‘

Well, hearing this *3-in-1* wording was weird, at least, especially when having [this](https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/1062342018758696960) in mind, or [this](https://twitter.com/holtbt/status/977419276251430912).

But what do I know, I'm a front-end developer, sorry, web developer... I mean I sometimes do websites, when I'm not ranting.

## I had to write this down
But there are some good articles on this matter in the wild and I strongly advise to go read them:

- [The problem with full-stack](http://www.heydonworks.com/article/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack) by Heydon Pickering

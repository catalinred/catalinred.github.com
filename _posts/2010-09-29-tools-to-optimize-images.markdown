Adobe Photoshop's **save for web** does a very good job when it comes about optimizing images but what happens when you wanna go beyond that, when you wish to obtain minimum size for your images?

A smaller image means a faster web page, lower bandwidth consumption so you have a lot of reasons to optimize your images. In the following rows I'll introduce you some tools that will help you achieve this.

I mean I literally inspected the [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) website and I wrote down some random findings and first impressions on HTML, CSS and more.

<!-- more -->

So, mostly due to curiosity and after seeing a lot of people mentioning Mastodon, the social network, I decided to join the hype.

I went ahead and decided to create a new account for Mastodon. With this in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to write down some of my first impressions, both as a user and web developer.

## What is Mastodon

> Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on open web protocols like ActivityPub and OStatus.

There are a lot of things I read and liked about Mastodon: the aim for a good user interface or the desire to create clean REST API for 3rd party apps. But what remained in my head is the **focus on robust anti-abuse tools**, which is something that Twitter is blamed for.

And it looks like Mastodon is an open source alternative to Twitter.

So I encourage you to read more about this project on Patreon and GitHub:

- Gargron/Eugen Rochko is creating [Mastodon on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon)
- Everything related to Mastodon is on [GitHub](https://github.com/tootsuite)

## mastodon.social üëç

Now, what first caught my attention was the cool name and top-level domain (TLD) they came up with: `mastodon.social`. It's short and easy to remember, also note that the `.social` TLD is available since 2014.

I appreciate the research behind this and I also like new cool TLDs too: see the current `.red` one in the address bar. Still, I'm curious about the long-term plans, considering the mastodon.com domain appears to be on sale now. What a coincidence!

So I guess someone will *Get Rich or Die Tryin'*.

## Signing up üëç

So I signed up for a new account and got a beautiful verification email. Also, while trying to sign up, I learned that Chrome has a built-in password generator that can be useful when signing up for a new account. [Didn't know that before](https://twitter.com/catalinred/status/1032961120779292673).

![Mastodon sign up email preview](/dist/uploads/2018/08/email.png)

I have been doing some email design & coding recently and I was able to recognize a well-designed email, with a nice logo and a clear call-to-action button.

## First sign in üëé

I've verified my email address but I certainly didn't enjoy the browser notification popup shown just after couple seconds I've signed in. It's intrusive and I'd have expected a notification like that only later on after the first sign in.

## Missing `meta name=description` üëé
The page has no `meta name=description` which is kind of surprising, therefore Google takes the first important text found on the page as a replacement instead.

![Mastodon missing meta description](/dist/uploads/2018/08/meta-description.png)

The thing is there is an existing [og:description](http://ogp.me/) but the best practice is to have both, for both search engines and social sharing.

## No `type=text/css` or `type=text/javascript` üëç

I liked the fact that the markup contains a clean `doctype`, a specified language for the `html` tag along with no redundant `type=text/css` or `type=text/javascript` attributes and values.

I'm still thinking what is the reason for modern websites like slack.com to keep using the above `type=text/...` stuff in the source. [It's redundancy](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#element-attrdef-script-type).

You may hit `view-source:https://slack.com/`, it's same situation since [last time I checked](https://twitter.com/catalinred/status/918491998918795265), in October 2017.

## HTTP2 üëç
While checking out the network panel, noticed the websites resources are served via HTTP2. The GZIP compression is enabled too.

![Mastodon network panel](/dist/uploads/2018/08/http2.png)

Overall, the website is super-fast, it uses Webpack to bundle the JS and the right sidebar feed is powered by React.

## CSS Reset üëé

Personally, I like to preserve useful defaults instead of clearing everything with a CSS Reset. A tool like [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), comparing to the classic CSS Reset helps to learn how elements are *meant* to display actually.

## CSS selectors üëé

This is what [Sass files](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/tree/995f8b389a66ab76ec92d9a240de376f1fc13a38/app/javascript/styles) do to your CSS files if you abuse nesting:

{% highlight css %}
.public-layout .public-account-header__tabs__tabs .counter .counter-label {
  ...
}

.public-layout .public-account-header__extra .public-account-bio .account__header__fields {
  ...
}

.reply-indicator__content.status__content--with-spoiler .status__content__text {
  ...
}

.regeneration-indicator.missing-indicator .regeneration-indicator__figure {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Flexbox & Grid üëç

I browsed the styles and it was nice to see Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout are used mostly everywhere.

## FontAwesome üëé
Not a big fan of the FontAwesome icon font as a solution for icons, not anymore. But I guess an SVG icon system will replace those very soon. SVG icon fonts are so much easier to work with.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- FontAwesome icon  -->
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-leaf"></i>
{% endhighlight %}

Also, too many fonts maybe?

### Missing `alt` üëé
Both [Tenon](https://tenon.io/) and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) accessibility audits are failing because there's a missing `alt` attribute for the bottom mastodon image.

![Mastodon paper airplane](/dist/uploads/2018/08/mastodon-paper-airplane.png)

## `target=_blank` üëé

> When your page links to another page using target="_blank", the new page runs on the same process as your page. If the new page is executing expensive JavaScript, your page's performance may also suffer.
from [Ligthouse docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener)

There are some missing `rel=noopener` or `rel=noreferrer` attributes when using `target=_blank` in order to open links in new tabs. Not sure about the potential risks here though because the linking is basic *internally* to say so, between the Mastodon website and app.

I also wrote about the findings on this subject a while ago, feel free to check out [the (not so up-to-date) numbers on this matter on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/random-interesting-facts-htmlsvg-usage/#article-header-id-6).

## More

- The Google Pagespeed scores are kind of low due to missing enabled compression, 64/100 on Mobile and 85/100 for Desktop. Why it matters? One reason is that website speed has been an SEO ranking factor for years.

- It looks like the HTML `<h2>` tag is missing completely, while there's a unique `<h1>` and multiple `<h3>` tags on the page.

- The `<bdi>` element is not supported in all browsers and I'm curious if there's a polyfill used for that.

- When it comes to SEO and content best practices, the audits warn about uninformative link texts:
  > Do not use generic text in links. Use text in the link that accurately and concisely conveys where the link goes.

{% highlight html %}
<a class="button button-alternative" href="/about/more">Learn more</a>
<a class="button button-alternative" href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Learn more</a>
{% endhighlight %}

## The social me

I left Facebook a while ago and never looked back. I didn't like the interaction with the people in there and like many others, I didn't like the company for sure.

I have lots of concerns on Twitter as a company, I agree with most things [@kizmarh](https://twitter.com/kizmarh/status/1032700826400317440) tweeted, but I definitely love the people on Twitter. Today Twitter is the place where I search and get validation from, the place where I interact and learn things from some awesome people I follow.

For everything else, there's the `Unfollow` button.

## Why Mastodon

I like to [dig into web page sources](https://catalin.red/awrstudyr-chrome-extension/) from time to time to see how others are writing markup and stuff. I'm a bit like *Everyday I'm hustl... inspectin'*.

Mastodon was the choice for this article as *the new guy* in town always gets all the attention. And because I've seen @kizmarh's [tweet](https://twitter.com/kizmarh/status/1032700826400317440) of course üôÇ

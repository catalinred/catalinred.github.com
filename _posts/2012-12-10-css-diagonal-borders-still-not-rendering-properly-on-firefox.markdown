The title pretty much says it all. These days I was working on a small web project and while creating the so well known [triangle effect](/how-to-create-triangle-shapes) using CSS borders I've noticed some rendering inconsistencies on Firefox I thought they were fixed by now.

Mozilla's Firefox is one of the browsers that use anti-aliasing for CSS diagonal borders. But, there's no problem at all with anti-aliasing for diagonal borders as long as the rendering is made accordingly. IE9 and IE10, the other browsers who use anti-aliasing, do it correctly but unfortunately at this time Firefox don't.

## First issue

I read and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/catalinred/statuses/233523307075477505) a while ago a good article by [Chris Morgan](https://twitter.com/__chrismorgan) where he explains how and why [CSS's "transparent" may not be transparent](https://coderwall.com/p/tpmsta), especially on diagonal borders.

Let's say you have the following CSS triangle made with:    

{% highlight css %}
div {
    border-top: 150px solid transparent;
    border-left: 150px solid red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is equivalent to:

{% highlight css %}
/* red = rgba(255,0,0,0) */

div {
    border-top: 150px solid rgba(255,0,0,0);
    border-left: 150px solid red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Workaround

So, to make it work nicely also in Firefox, you need to avoid the use of `transparent` value and use instead the appropriate `RGB` color with `alpha = 0`.

### CSS tip

The `transparent` value is equivalent to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

## Second issue

In my small project I was telling you earlier, I use an abstract block delimiter built with a CSS border triangle. The thing is that my block is quite large, as it's meant to _break_ two sections of a website.

Here's the block delimiter example:
    
{% highlight css %}
div {
    border-top: 70px solid rgba(0, 255, 0, 0);
    border-left: 600px solid green;
}
{% endhighlight %}


![CSS borders on Firefox - large border example](/dist/uploads/2012/12/css-borders-firefox-large-border.png)

If you're using Firefox, you can notice a blurry transition on the diagonals caused by the anti-aliasing. That's quite annoying and the RGBA trick does not solve it.


### My workaround

What does it is a dirty workaround I discovered while playing with it: `-moz-transform: scale(.9999)`. Apparently, a small scaling is applied but visually you won't see the difference. Also, technically you wouldn't need the prefix for this transformation as Firefox support it [unprefixed since version 16](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/aurora-16-is-out/).

But, since this is a Firefox only hack, I think using the prefixed version is a good idea.

{% highlight css %}
div {
    border-top: 70px solid rgba(0, 255, 0, 0);
    border-left: 600px solid green;
    -moz-transform: scale(.9999);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Firefox testing

Bad behavior on:
	
  * Mozilla Firefox 17.0.1	
  * Mozilla Firefox 18.0 - beta channel	
  * Aurora 19.0a2 (2012-12-06)

As far as I tested, it seems that this behavior is fixed on Mozilla Firefox Nightly 20.0a1. So that's really good news, even if we'll have to wait a bit until Mozilla Firefox release hits that version.

## That's it

If you're like me and like all these CSS small thingies, then you'll enjoy this article. Don't hesitate to leave a comment and thanks for reading!

P.S. Even if I wrote before that [Firefox doesnâ€™t allow cross-domain fonts](/firefox-doesnt-allow-cross-domain-fonts-by-default), I still love Firefox because it's the only one, at this time, that allows animations for CSS pseudo elements. Hopefully, the other browsers will catch up eventually.

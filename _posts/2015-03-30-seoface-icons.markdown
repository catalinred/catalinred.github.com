There are a lot of great icon packs in the wild, but if you're particularly looking for some SEO icons like stats, analytics, rankings or localization then you may want a bit more diversity to choose from.

I encountered many situations when I was wishing they were a bit more extra SEO related glyphs to play with. That's why I encouraged myself to start working on SEOface (I kinda liked this name), my very first icon set attempt.

My thoughts on this were to have some scalable vector icons that can be easily customized and embedded into any project. So there you go, SEOface is a free and minimal SEO oriented icon collection you can use right away.

The download archive includes 50 icons in the following formats:

- SVG
- EPS
- AI
- PDF
- PNG

Feel free to use these icons in your projects, with or without any attribution. The same with everything you can find on this website.

## And that's it. Enjoy!

Further, I'm thinking about maybe working more on this icon pack and try to expand it as much as possible. Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts. Any feedback is appreciated.

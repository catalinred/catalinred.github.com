Currently, I'm just one in a huge crowd, a [prospect](http://dribbble.com/catalinred) who has seen so many "dribbbles" and who learned a lot of new techniques. 

Today's post is about... me. With your permission and hoping I'm not too selfish, I'd like to show you some of my latest CSS3 designs.

## Ready to play

If you think I'm a good [prospect](http://dribbble.com/catalinred), and you think I've got what it takes to became an draftee, then I'd appreciate if you could send me a [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) invite.

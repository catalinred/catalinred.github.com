You've seen triangles everywhere: on [tooltips](http://www.red-team-design.com/easy-css3-jquery-tooltips), [dropdowns](http://www.red-team-design.com/css3-animated-dropdown-menu) and even on [loading animations](http://www.red-team-design.com/css3-loading-animation-experiment). Like it or not, these small elements are quite important when trying to build some relationships between various UI elements.

There are some different ways to build a triangle for your web designs and in this article you'll see how you can actually do that.

## Encoded image

Assuming you already created your custom triangle image and you want to save a valuable HTTP request, then converting it into a base64 string is the best solution.

### Useful tools:
	
  * [http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter](http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter)	
  * [http://image2base64.wemakesites.net/](http://image2base64.wemakesites.net/)

### Pros
	
  * You can design it as you wish using shadows, gradients and strokes and then just encode it.

### Cons
	
  * You'll need a tool like Photoshop/Gimp to edit it.	
  * For larger images, the resulting string can be quite huge.	
  * Older browsers like IE6/IE7 do not support this type of encoding.

## CSS borders

![CSS border triangle](/dist/uploads/2012/09/border-triangle.png)

This is also a pretty common technique used on stuff like [tooltips](http://www.red-team-design.com/css3-tooltips) and [dropdowns](http://www.red-team-design.com/css3-dropdown-menu). Together with the above, this is one of my favorite methods for creating small and useful triangles.

### Pros
	
  * Easy to update color and size by adjusting some CSS values.	
  * This is a cross browser solution.

### Cons
	
  * This technique consist of using borders, so you can't add shadows, gradients and other CSS3 awesomeness.
	
  * Keep in mind that IE6 doesn't support transparent borders - in case you care about this matter anymore.
	
  * If you're using Firefox, be aware that CSS's "transparent" may not be transparent, especially on diagonal borders. Read more about this [here](http://coderwall.com/p/tpmsta).

## HTML entity

![HTML entity triangle](/dist/uploads/2012/09/entity-triangle.png)

If you read my [previous](http://www.red-team-design.com/simple-and-effective-dropdown-login-box) [articles](http://www.red-team-design.com/just-another-awesome-css3-buttons), then you've seen how this solution works. It's based on using characters from the available [Unicode characters list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).

### Pros
	
  * It's a cross browser technique.        
  * You can add a shadow using CSS3's `text-shadow` property.

### Cons
	
  * Again, you can't play too much with CSS3 here, excepting the use of `text-shadow`.	
  * It's quite impossible to achieve pixel perfection across all browsers.

Don't forget to check this wonderful resource: [http://copypastecharacter.com/](http://copypastecharacter.com/).

Besides using an entity, if you're already using an [iconic font](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) in your project, then you can simply use an arrow symbol from the available ones (in case there is one).

## CSS rotated square

![Cropped triangle with CSS](/dist/uploads/2012/09/cropped-triangle.png)

Basically, for this technique to work, you'll need two blocks. But, it's not mandatory to use two elements, so you can use an element with a pseudo-element for example.
	
  * Create a box. e.g. 100x100 px - this one will contain the rotated block.

  * Rotate the contained block by 45deg to obtain the diamond shape.

  * Shift the diamond shape to the top then set `overflow: hidden` to the wrapping block to show just the part we're interested in.
	
  * There you go!

### Pros
        
  * The possibility of playing with CSS3 box shadow, gradients etc.

### Cons
	
  * This solution is not cross browser, first of all because of the CSS3 transform, unless perhaps you're a bit crazy and use something like [cssSandpaper](http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/03/09/cross-browser-css-transforms-even-in-ie/).

## HTML5 Canvas

Having the following `canvas` element in your HTML file:
    
{% highlight html %}
<canvas id="triangle" height="100" width="100">Triangle</canvas>
{% endhighlight %}

... here's how to draw a triangle using JavaScript:    

{% highlight js %}
var canvas = document.getElementById('triangle');
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(0, 0);
context.lineTo(100, 0);
context.lineTo(50, 100);
 
context.closePath();

context.fillStyle = "rgb(78, 193, 243)";
context.fill();
{% endhighlight %}

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

This is how you can define an inline SVG triangle in your markup:
    
{% highlight html %}
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" class="svg-triangle">
  <polygon points="0,0 100,0 50,100"/>
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

Then, just add some styles:

{% highlight css %}
.svg-triangle{
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;    
}   

.svg-triangle polygon {
  fill:#98d02e;
  stroke:#65b81d;
  stroke-width:2;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Final words

I must admit I haven't played too much with the last two described in this article: `canvas` and `SVG`. This is something I must improve in the future as they are very powerful. Anyways, the truth is that they were made for things greater than just trivial triangles :)

Let me know your thoughts about these ways to build triangles, what is the method you use more often?

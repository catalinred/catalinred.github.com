HTML5 is being developed as the next major revision of HTML, the core markup language of the World Wide Web. Besides new elements like `header`, `section`, `footer`, etc., the HTML5 brings you the `canvas` element. 

The canvas is a rectangular area within you can use Javascript to draw graphics or other visual images on a web page. Although HTML5 is not a W3C recommendation yet, people already started to play with it, and when I say _play_, I mean it. 

Today I'll share with you some awesome HTML5 games demos that show the HTML5 canvas potential.

A common misconception is that HTML 5 can provide animation within web pages, which is totally **untrue**. Either JavaScript or CSS3 (or both) is necessary for animating HTML elements.

The New Year is coming and I have wrote this short post to **thank you all** sincerely for reading my articles. I think I should say it more often as well.

## 2012 and me

  * I turned 27 years old. Still young and restless.

  * I celebrated 2 years since I got married to my beautiful wife Larisa.

  * I managed to [redesign my website](/new-responsive-design-for-rtd). Nothing too fancy, but I finally made it!

  * It has been 4 years since I work at [Caphyon](http://www.caphyon.com/). Still love it. They even put my "mug shot" [on the about page](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/about.html).

  * I wrote about 25 articles on RedTeamDesign... in a year. Less is more :) Yeah right! Actually I have to improve my ninja skills to beat procrastination.

  * My only guest post this year was published on [Speckyboy](http://speckyboy.com/2012/02/15/how-to-build-a-stylish-css3-search-box/). Procrastination striked... again.

  * I did a lot of small, insignificant things...

P.S. How did you spent the end of the world? I was working.

## New Year's resolutions


  * I've always been crazy about soccer, big fan and amateur player. In 2013 I will try to do sport more often than I do now.

  * When I started as a freelancer years ago, I met Photoshop and it was my first love. Then I discovered that CSS is definitely one of my passions too. Next year, I will give my best to learn more about JavaScript.

  * I must admit I never read to much, other than technical books. So, in the future I want to improve that and read more.

  * Least but not last, I wish to be healthy and get rich and famous! :)

As you probably found out, yesterday, the The World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has unveiled the [HTML5 Logo](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/). They launched more than a logo as they got also a full branding, including badges, t-shirts and stickers.

So, I suppose that's a good thing, that HTML5 got some branding, sounds very interesting!

While looking at it and admiring it, as I find it very nice, I thought about how can I **do it with CSS3** (typically for me).

What about the logo? _It's A Bird... It's A Plane... _

No, it's the new HTML5 logo and in this article I'll design it **using only CSS**!

## Concept

Getting back to our business, I thought about the _ingredients_ I'd need for this angular orange shield:

  * CSS borders shapes
  * `:before` and `:after` pseudo-elements
  * CSS3 properties that I used: `opacity` and `transform`
  * [Geo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geo) font via Google font API
  * Some empty divs to build the five number_(later edit)_

### CSS borders shapes

As seen before, in one of my previous articles, you can achieve [angled shapes](/happy-holidays-with-css3) using CSS borders. In this case, I used borders in order to recreate the shield icon.

### :before and :after pseudo-elements

Using this type of selectors it's helpful when you  want to achieve a minimal HTML markup.

### CSS3 opacity and transform

Even if the article's name says : "HTML5 Logo made with CSS3", this isn't mainly about CSS3, but, `opacity` and `transform` properties were very useful for this.

### Custom font

The method I'll use to display the _5_ number is to include  the [Geo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geo) font via [Google Font API](https://fonts.google.com/).

I know it's not identical, but, at the time I wrote this article, I found it quite similar. Instead, I'd appreciate if you could suggest me a better font to use for the number.

_Later edit:_


For a perfect result, I guess I could have used CSS3 [skew transformation](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#SkewXDefined) and a lot of empty divs to create the "5" number ...

## My <del>initial </del> result:

I know it's not perfect, especially the _5_ number, but I hope you will still like it! Check the below demonstration page:

## Updated result

I finally made it, I updated the initial HTML5 logo. Instead the custom font, empty divs were used in order to replicate the logo.

Now you have it! Minimal HTML markup, CSS3 transforms and pseudo-elements:

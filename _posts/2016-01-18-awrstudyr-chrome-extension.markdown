If you'd ask me what I've been up lately, I'd say: working, reading, learning - pretty much just like you, I guess. The thing is it's been a while since I wrote something here and my first article this year is about AWRstudyr, a Chrome extension I've been working lately and it's something I've put lots of effort into it.

If you're like me, you hit `view source` on a regular basis while browsing just every time you enjoy, dislike or when being too curious onto something. And when `view source` is not enough, you go `F12` and try to stumble upon on how things work down there.

So, I started thinking on a tool that could deliver relevant info for a web page without having to repeat the above steps every time I wanted to find out more about the tools and frameworks a page uses. Feedback was crucial and I was interested mainly if there were more people having my problem - trying to get as many data possible for an URL at first sight.

As a result, together with my colleagues at Caphyon, we made [AWRstudyr](http://www.awrstudyr.com/) - a Chrome extension that shows web page insights on SEO gathered from a keyword research database compiled from a set of 30 million keywords, plus lots of web development answers like:

- What web server is behind the URL?
- What Analytics tool is used to get visitor insights?
- What Marketing or Chat tools are used to convert the visitors?
- What Advertising network is running in order to sell ads?
- What CMS powers the forum, blog or the online shop?
- What CSS and JS frameworks are used to build that user interface?

and more...

- Is the page mobile-friendly and how does it look like on small devices?
- What Google PageSpeed scores does that URL have?
- Is that URL HTML5 valid according to W3C?
- Does this URL have mixed content that can break the SSL?
- How many times does this URL has been shared in the wild?

In case the above reasons are enough for you, you can give AWRStudyr a try and [get it on Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awrstudyr/mbkehkfjhncahcaggkncdaacfnikmoid). I hope you'll find this useful and I'm looking forward to your feedback!

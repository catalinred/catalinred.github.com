## Who am I?
Hello, my name is Catalin Rosu and I'm a web designer, developer and gamer. I'm that guy who loves to sit in front of his computer almost all the time. This is my personal website where I like to do stuff as writing tutorials and share front-end stuff.

I live in Craiova, Romania and currently work at <a href="http://www.caphyon.com/">Caphyon</a>. I have a computer science degree but most of my knowledge comes from reading, blogging, and learning from those I've worked with along the time.

When I'm not doing all of these, I play video games on my <del datetime="2011-11-28T19:02:45+00:00">PS3</del> Xbox 360 and hanging out with my friends.

## Why Red?
Because my name Rosu (RO) means Red (EN). That's why all my friends call me Red and it explains my twitter handle as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/catalinred">@catalinred</a>
